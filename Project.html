        <ul>
            <li class="text">Lucknow is widely referred to as the “city of Nawabs.” Lucknow has been located near the river Gomti banks since the Suryavanshi dynasty. It is known as the capital of Uttar Pradesh. Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula has established it.In ancient times, the nawabs ruled Lucknow and were their capital. It is one of the sole reasons it is also referred to as the Nawabs city. The ancient era where the Nawabs ruled Lucknow gave this city the rich and polite culture and delightful cuisines for which it is popular in the present. Lucknow has not been affected by the massive modernization in the current world and has successfully maintained its elegance and ancient royalty/charm.</li>
